Bangle Gesture and AI v2
=========================

Built by making small tweaks to content from NodeConf EU 2019 workshop [repo](https://github.com/gfwilliams/workshop-nodeconfeu2019) and [Bangle.js and Edge Impulse for Machine Learning](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js+EdgeImpulse) examples.

I thought it is a good idea to include the magnetometer reading along with the accelerometer readings for a better gesture recognition and started messign up with the code

If you are a beginner like me, I highly recommend to have a look at the workshop
Bangle.js Workshop for Nodeconf EU 2019.

* [Step 1 - Getting Started](step1.md) - connection and simple commands
